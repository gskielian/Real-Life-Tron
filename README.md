Real-Life-Tron
==============

Using OpenCV and a Projector to make a top down TRON game for RC cars. 


## Inspiration:

## Description

We will basically reuse this code and have a really fast processor to simply scan the path of the RC car in the direction of the RC CAR in the playing field.

This could also be really easily integrated with Roboxes...
